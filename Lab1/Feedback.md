8 | No timing, no discussion about selection | 5 | No timing, missing answers | 5 | No timing, missing answers | 6 | No timing: no function testing | 8 | No timing: Consider the confidence of the functions that you are using | 9 | Nice solution. But requested is the smallest counter example not a list of primes. | 5 | you did not perform tests for invalid card numbers; | 9 | ->issues | 7 | ok Euler 9 | 7 | very nice Euler 10; incomplete Euler 49: why did you use the 3330 difference between tuple members? It was not stated as a must-have property of the solution, just as a property of the example. However, very fast implementation. | 7.575
